This is the first public release of **Goost**: an extension for
[**Godot Engine**](https://godotengine.org/)!

<!--more-->

Proceed to the [Download](/download.html) page to get the latest release of
Godot + Goost.

The purpose of this beta release is to get some general feedback from the
community. Goost is still young and haven't received much testing apart from the
Goost authors who take part in development - be it reporting bugs, improving
existing features, or creating new ones. If you'd like to know what Goost has to
offer, check out the [Features](/features.html) page.

Due to this, Goost will likely undergo some compatibility breakage in the early
stages of development.

We hope that you find Goost useful for fulfilling powerful ideas into your
projects. Remember: execution is only half the battle!
