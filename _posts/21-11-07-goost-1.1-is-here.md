Perhaps you thought you'd never see Goost 1.1 to be released, but we're here to
prove otherwise!

Here's the list of notable new features worth to be highlighted:

* [Use Git](https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/version_control.html)
  directly from the editor without having to download any plugins!
* It's now possible to [save GIFs](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/pull/104) from images!
* [Command-line parsing](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/pull/123) made easy!
* Experimental [multi-script](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/pull/92) support!
* ... and more.

Please
[report any issues](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/issues/new/choose) you
find with the extension. For more details about the release, proceed to relevant
[1.1-stable](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/discussions/142) release
discussion page at GitHub, and don't forget to spread the word!

By the way, you can also
[showcase your creations made with Goost](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/discussions/136)!
This is one of the best ways to support Goost, because it's a bridge which
allows Godot core developers to evaluate whether a particular feature is worth
integrating directly into Godot, and this is one of the major reasons why Goost
exists in the first place: to create a truly complete and a useful engine.

Thanks!
