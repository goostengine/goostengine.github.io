After a year of continuos voluntary work on both
[Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) and Goost, the extension can be
considered good enough to use in real-life projects.

Please
[report any issues](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/issues/new/choose) you
find with the extension. For more details about the release, proceed to relevant
[1.0-stable](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/discussions/82) release
discussion page at GitHub, and don't forget to spread the word!
