    <p>Goost is developed by people from all around the world, and we trust
      the community to fulfill the vision behind Goost in the best way possible.
      It is available under the permissive <b>MIT license</b>, so you can integrate
      the extension in any project without restrictions just like Godot.</p>
    <p>The extension is implemented as a
      <a href=https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/introduction_to_the_buildsystem.html#custom-modules>C++ module</a>.
      If you'd like to customize the extension yourself by picking only the features
      you need, go ahead and <a href="https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/building.html">get the source to build Godot with Goost</a>.</p>
    <p>For now, Goost is currently geared towards 2D and core development. If you'd like to
       share your tools with Goost to be used by people in various game development
       areas, we invite you to
