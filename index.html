      <a href="https://github.com/goostengine"><b>Goost</b></a> is a general-purpose,
      extensible and customizable <a href="https://godotengine.org/"><b>Godot Engine</b></a>
      extension written in C++. It aims to complement and extend the already
      powerful Godot core features in a way which allows to achieve high performance,
      expose built-in engine functionality and overcome various limitations
      that are difficult to workaround via scripting languages such as GDScript.
